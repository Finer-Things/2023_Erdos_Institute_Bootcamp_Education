# Predicting Academic Success

This repo includes some documentation of the group project Predicting Academic Success of NY Public Schools, which was prepared as part of the 2023 Data BootCamp. Predicting Academic Success of New York Public Schools project explores the predictors of graduation rate in New York public schools at elementary and high school levels. The project uses linear regression and classification.

# Key Question
Using school-level features, can we accurately predict school-level academic success for New York public (including charter) schools? 

In addition to informing parents, this information is critical to informing state and local leaders who attempt to improve public schools through policy creation and implementation.

# Data and Cleaning
We downloaded our data from [NY State Data](https://data.nysed.gov/downloads.php). This database comes in Microsoft Access Format and has XX different datasets. After exploring different spreadsheets, we decided to work with the following five files: 

* The file XX contains
* The file XX contains
* The file XX contains
* The file XX contains
* The file XX contains

# Exploratory Data Analysis
See ``ExploratoryDataAnalysis.ipynb`` for some Jupyter notebooks examining the data. We plotted scatter plots for our features, which are all continuous variables.

# Modeling
Using these data, we developed linear and non-linear models. See
